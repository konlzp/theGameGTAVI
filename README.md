	computer Graphics Final Project, based on NVMC code, chapter 4
	
	A third person shooter game in JS. You have limited number of bullets, kill all the enemies stand in your line!

	The parts that already accomplished includes: complicated characters in the game, multiple NPCs and their corresponding random
	movements, walking motion animation (walking forward & walking backward & jumping & turning), collision detection between
	characterand the buildings, collision detection between the bullet and the characters, theme music playing 
	(GTA V: welcome to los santos), walking step sound and gunshots sound.

	Improvements in mind:
	1. Draw different characters using different colors.
	2. Let the player character holding a pistol that shoots bullets instead of bumping the bullet straight from the character.
	3. Replace current direction = myVel() with a more accurate one (Camera direction? But I am not sure where to get this data).
	4. Design a better collision detection (what to do after a collision is detected, currently disable all the flags except backwards).
	5. Possibly some textures? But do I really need it?
